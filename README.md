# SoundWebsite
Project Name: Shower Thoughts

Project Description: For our sound assignment, we decided to make an interactive website hosting some random shower thoughts. 

Process: We first recorded the monologues that would be played on the website. We edited the sound effects on the monologues using audacity. Then, we went about building the website itself and making it interactive. We used HTML and CSS for the display of the contents and Javascript to switch between the monologues. The user is asked to interact with the webpage by clicking on the shower tap to start and to end the monologues. The user is also asked to click on the wall (background) to hear a new shower thought, which also changes color. 

Reflection/Evaluation: We had some issues with implementing the order of monologue transition. The monologues would keep repeating as long the user clicked on the wall. However, we were able to fix the JS code so that each monologue plays randomly but does not repeat the one that has been just played.
